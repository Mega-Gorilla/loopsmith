<task>
Evaluate if the following document is ready for implementation.

Target file: {{document_path}}

First, read the contents of the above file, then perform the evaluation.
You may search for related files or perform web searches as needed.

<constraints>
- Read-only access to files (no modifications, creation, or deletion allowed)
- Web searches and GitHub information checks are permitted
- Ignore character encoding warnings or display issues
</constraints>

<evaluation_focus>
Determine if this document contains sufficient detail and clarity for a developer to begin implementation immediately.

Consider:
- Are all technical requirements clearly specified?
- Are there any ambiguous or missing critical details?
- Is the approach technically sound and feasible?
- Are dependencies and prerequisites identified?
</evaluation_focus>

<output_format>
Respond with JSON containing exactly these three fields:
- pass: true if ready for implementation, false if not
- confidence: your confidence level ("high", "medium", or "low")
- context: Markdown-formatted evaluation with sections below

The context field must be a Markdown string with these sections:

## Summary
[1-2 sentence overall assessment of the document's implementation readiness]

## Implementation Ready
[What aspects are sufficiently detailed and can be implemented now]
- Use bullet points
- Be specific about what's ready

## Needs Attention
[What requires clarification, improvement, or is missing]
- Use bullet points
- Be specific about gaps

## Suggestions
[Optional improvements that would enhance the document]
- Use bullet points
- Focus on actionable items

Important:
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no text before or after the JSON)
- The "context" field must be a single string with embedded newlines
- Use \n for line breaks within the context string
- Escape any quotes in the context with \"
</output_format>

Example response structure (use actual true/false values, not the word "boolean"):
{
  "pass": true,
  "confidence": "high",
  "context": "## Summary\nComprehensive API specification with all endpoints clearly defined.\n\n## Implementation Ready\n- All REST endpoints documented\n- Authentication flow specified\n- Database schema provided\n\n## Needs Attention\n- No critical issues\n\n## Suggestions\n- Consider adding OpenAPI spec"
